## Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers, 19-48 years of age. Each person performed six activities (walking, walking up stairs, walking down stairs, sitting, standing, laying) while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on their waist. Using its accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments were video-recorded, and the data were labelled manually.

## Data Files
This dataset includes the following files:
'README.md' - This is the information file that you are currently reading.
'variableMeans.txt' - This file contains 180 rows of data and 66 columns. Each row corresponds to a subject-activity pair (30 subjects * 6 activities  = 180 rows).  Each of the 66 columns corresponds to the mean value of all measurements taken for that subject-activity pair, for 66 different variables.
'CodeBook.md' - This file contains information about the data and variables found in the data files.
'run_analysis.R' - This is the script that was run on the original data, to produce the data that is presented here. The mean and std variables were extracted from the original data set, then all the measurements for each variable with the same subject and activity were averaged.
